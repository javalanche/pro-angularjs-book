<h2>Cool litle trick</h2>
<p>
you can see how I check for the value of the attribute
if there is no unordered-list attribute value available:
</p>
<li>
	var data = scope[attrs["unorderedList"] || attrs["listSource"]];
</li>
<h2> Listing 16-5. Applying a Directive as a class Attribute Value in the directives.html File </h2>
<textarea name="desc" rows="8" cols="100">
...
<div class="panel-body">
	<div class="unordered-list: products" list-property="price | currency"></div>
</div>
...
</textarea>
<p>
I have cheated slightly in this example and defined a list-property attribute on the element to which the directive
has been applied. Of course, if I were able to do that in a real project, then I wouldn’t need to apply the directive
through the class attribute in the first place. In a real project where I need to apply in class, I would have to do something like this:
</p>
<textarea name="desc" rows="8" cols="100">
...
<div class="panel-body">
	<div class="unordered-list: products, price | currency"></div>
</div>
...
</textarea>
<p>
This would cause AngularJS to provide the directive link function with a value for the unorderedList attribute
of "products, price | currency", and I would then be responsible for parsing the value in the link function. I</p>
